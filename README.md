This repository is for the purposes of software engineering interviews.

It is intended to be a snapshot of a small portion of the real platform, mangled into a small enough state where it can be stood up on its own and with enough logic that someone could make small changes to it in isolation.

The real codebase DOES NOT look like and is NOT laid out like this!

# TASK

1. Clone the code. Build and run/debug to get a feel for it. It is a VERY cut down section of the customer's "My Account" section with a lot of things 'faked'.

2. Read the "brief" issue - and ask questions via the issue comments of the business sponsor (Kieran). Drop Kieran an email when you are ready for those to be reviewed and to allow a second round of questions if necessary.

3. Try breaking down the briefing (with the added context of comments and responses) into work TASKS - a bulleted list of things that you think will need changing in the code to support the new feature. If you can, be specific based on the source code provided, if not keep it high level as to what you think might need to be done.

4. Create a branch for the issue (+ a pull request for the branch when you are ready) and try and implement one or two of your tasks into the code. Obviously you are limited by the level of implementation in there - so don't go crazy, just do what you can, say showing a new my account section for 'friends and family', a new controller/view for that outputting a list of family members backed by a service call that generated faked data.

5. Push your code to the branch in github, and let Kieran know when you're done.

Do NOT spend any longer than two hours on this, I do not expect an extended period of effort. I want to understand how you break a problem down.
